    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      “Imagine, I might really become somebody. Someday.” Maya Angolou. No, hold your thought right there, actually imagine I will be a software developer". Yes this is the drive that holds me, a growth mindset. I am Jane Njihia and I am 25 years old. My basic attributes are that I am an outgoing person, very social and enjoy politics. A software developer in making tech fascinates me. A lover of sweet bitter experiences, or rather call them adventures. I am a graduate from the University of Nairobi. Graduated with a second class upper division in Bachelors (double major, political science and public admin and sociology). Have worked in finance for 3years. project management for 3years. Tech support for 1.5 years. I decided to venture into programming as Programming fascinates me, you know, in that I can order food at home and it gets to me in minutes. so cool.

    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I have very few hobbies; paintballing, beach walks, leisure and nature walks. Water soothes me. When I feel so pressured, watching a lake, ocean or just a fall feels therapeutic to me. I love cool breezes especially in the evening.
